Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm an avid book reader and working on making my other hobby, writing, my daily habit. What better way to write more often than to write about something I'm obsessed about.

I'll read just about anything as long as the story or the writing is good. I've read books with mundane plots but stellar writing and the exact opposite happened on my reading journey. However, my favorate genres have to be contemporary, magical realism, and comedy.

Before I made this blog, I used to write for local events in my college town. I love exploring new places and trying new things that the city had to offer. If you want to know what I used to write, you can go to the the link to my old works <a href="{{ site.dentoniteUrl }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
