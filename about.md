Hello and welcome to my blog! I have been in love with reading as a hobby and now pursue wrtating as a career and hope you will enjoy my reviews as I blog about it along the way.

I'll read just about anything, as long as it does not envolve country music. However, my favorate ganeras have to be romance and comedy. I strive to
hit my goodreads goals every year but I keep it casual and laid back.
